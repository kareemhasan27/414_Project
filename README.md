This repository contains the code and resources for predicting mood swings using the RHMCD-20 dataset collected in Bangladesh. Leveraging machine learning models, we aim to identify individuals at elevated risk of rapid emotional fluctuations (mood swings) to support early intervention and targeted mental health strategies.

Mood swings pose challenges to well-being and signal underlying conditions like anxiety or depression. In Bangladesh, cultural stigma leads to underreporting of mental health issues, making these approaches crucial. Using demographic and behavioral variables (age, gender, time spent indoors, stress levels, habit changes, mental health history, weight change, coping struggles, etc.), we trained tree-based models to predict mood swing severity and uncover predictors.

All dependencies: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost and catboost, should be in requirements.txt. To set up the environment, find the original data titled raw in data/raw and clone the repository, then install dependencies. Running the pipeline would be running dataset.py for data checks, features.py for all encoding and feature engineering, train.py for model training and MAE/cross-validation (including stdev), and plots.py for all visualizations and interpretations. Each script runs independently and reproduces project results. This pipeline is  made for reproducibility and is intended for use by NGOs and health organizations for identifying at-risk individuals for proactive mental health interventions.
